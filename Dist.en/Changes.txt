		     LetMeType's Revision History

1.81
----

- Instead of inserting the suggestions by simulating keyboard input, 
  LetMeType now uses the clipboard. This makes inserting special
  characters which are not available with the current keyboard layout
  more reliable.

- The task bar symbol is displayed permanently again. By clicking on
  it, suggestions and the learning of new words can be toggled.

- LetMeType uses a faster and more reliable way to simulate 
  keyboard input.

- Recognition of keyboard input is done in a new way, too.
  This allows LetMeType to work with Borland Delphi.

- Another change makes LetMeType work with MS Intelligent Forms,
  which are used in Internet Explorer.

- A list of applications can be defined to which LetMeType will
  either limit itself, or which it will ignore. So you can 
  activate it in your development environment, while keeping it
  silent when typing emails.

- Suggestions can be selected by clicking on them with the mouse.

- During its automatic garbage collection, LetMeType will no longer
  expedite the deletion of words which have only occured one or two 
  times.

- The task bar symbol is only shown when the main window is minimized.

1.78
----

- LetMeType is no longer distributed as Shareware, but can be freely
  copied according to the GNU General Public License, including the
  source code. The limitations of the Shareware version have been
  removed.

- It is no longer possible to encrypt the vocabulary file. Before you
  upgrade from an older version, you have to save your vocabulary
  unencrypted.

1.77
----

- Words that only have occured one or two times, are removed from the
  vocabulary after 10 or 20 days respectively.
- When making suggestions, LetMeType favors words that have been used 
  recently.
- No suggestions are made in hidden password fields, if they are to be 
  ignored (File - Settings).
- Closing the main window does no longer quit LetMeType, it only hides 
  the window. The only way to exit LetMeType is by using menu item
  "File - Exit".
- If "Numeric Keypad" is deactivated in "File - Settings", suggestions
  can only be selected using the normal digit keys. This way, the
  numeric keypad can be used to enter numbers while LetMeType displays
  its suggestion window.

1.76
----

- Menu item "File - Merge" for adding words from a vocabulary file.

- The state of "Settings - Monitor Clipboard" is permanently saved
  again. In the previous version, the function always was activated
  when LetMeType was started.
- Words which LetMeType automatically pasted from the clipboard are not
  saved if the vocabulary is set to "read-only".


1.75
----

- The time after which the suggestion window is automatically hidden
  can be adjusted.
- You can move the suggestion window to change its distance from the
  caret, and the window can be displayed next to the mouse pointer
  instead of the caret. After moving the suggestion window, a dialog
  will allow you to change these settings.

- When Outlook Express 5 was used, LetMeType was unable to enter
  certain characters, including umlauts. This was caused by OE5
  processing a key which every Windows program should ignore.
  LetMeType now avoids this incompatibility.

1.74
----

- Numbers can be excluded from the vocabulary.

- During startup, the window size set in a shortcut (e.g. Minimized) 
  was not always honored.
- After a word had been deleted or edited, the vocabulary was not
  marked as modified, and therefore sometimes these changes were not
  saved.

LetMeType is now shipped with a setup program to make installation
easier and provide uninstall support. No changes have been made to the
application itself.

1.72
----

- Suggestions and the learning of new words can be disabled separately.
- LetMeType can quickly be deactivated and switched on again by
  clicking on its tray icon. The icon is visible all the time,
  and indicates the deactived state with a red cross.
- "Words" may start with a digit.
- Optionally, LetMeType learns words entered in hidden password fields.
  (Previously, these fields were always ignored.)

Fixed Bugs:

- After clipboard monitoring had been deactivated, LetMeType would
  crash the next time it was started.
- If the path in which LetMeType.exe was located contained space
  characters, the association between the application and its
  documents was broken.

- LetMeType now can automatically monitor the clipboard and add its
  contents to the vocabulary.
- Added a couple of Russian letters.

- The window size specified in a shortcut to the executable or a document
  (e.g. "minimized") was ignored so far.
- Reading text from a file sometimes caused a crash under WinNT.
- Made it harder to forge the registration key.

- The suggestions can now be selected by using the numeric keypad instead of 
  the normal digit keys.
- Context menu for the word list.

- Reading text from the clipboard did not always work correctly.

1.63
----

- Under WinNT, LetMeType caused some applications to print an error message
  when they were shut down.

Published: 2/22/1999


1.62
----

- Added a Russian letter to the "Word Characters" dialog.

- Keyboard layouts where caps lock only shifts certain characters are
  handled correctly.
- The association between the application and its document files (*.lmt)
  now works better. This allows one to open a new vocabulary in an
  already running instance of LetMeType by double-clicking on the .lmt file
  in Windows Explorer.
- The tray icon sometimes mysteriously disappeared.

- The font of the suggestion window is user-selectable.

- The automatic typing of characters that, like "á", require multiple 
  keystrokes, now works.

Published: 1/18/1999


1.53
----

- If you activate the "Read-only" setting, newly typed words will now be
  memorized by LetMeType, but not stored on disk. I.e. the words can be used
  as long as LetMeType runs, but will be discarded when the program exits.
  Words added using "File - Import Text" will always be stored permanently.

1.52
----

- LetMeType does not store new words typed in password fields. 
  (This only works for the built-in Windows password field, which displays
   entered characters as asterisks.)

Published: 11/29/1998


1.51
----

- By default, LetMeType ignores a word's capitalization when computing
  the suggestions.
- The size and age limits for the vocabulary have been raised.

- Selecting a suggestion while caps lock is activated now works.
- When importing a word list with one word per line, LetMeType no longer
  stores word sequences. Therefore you will not see a suggestion like
  "dragoon dragster" just because the words appeared next to each other
  in the imported dictionary.
