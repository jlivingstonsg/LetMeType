Introduction
============

LetMeType helps you enter text. Running in the background, it analyses
what you type. After some time it has collected enough information to
guess a word after you have typed the first two or three letters. A
list of the most probable words is displayed, and you can select one
with a single keystroke or just continue typing.

This works independently of the program you enter the text into - be
it a word processor, the editor of a development environment or a
dialog box field.
